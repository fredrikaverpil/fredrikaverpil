### Hi there 👋

I am a passionate, enthusiastic and professional software developer (since 2012), continuously striving to evolve with Python as the primary language of choice — and preferably building scalable and reliable solutions in public cloud environments such as GCP, AWS or Azure. 

I advocate continuous development, automated testing, clean code and the use of common design patterns so as to maintain as high code quality as possible. I am deeply invested in the open source community and love collaborating and contributing.

- 🔭 I’m preparing to start a new position as backend developer at [Doktor](https://en.doktor.se/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on websockets, Redis, k8s, AWS, PostgreSQL, task queues, gRPC
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fredrikaverpil), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredrik/)
