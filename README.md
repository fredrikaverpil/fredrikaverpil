### Hi there 👋

I am a passionate, enthusiastic and professional Python developer (since 2012), continuously striving to evolve with Python as the primary language of choice. 

Preferably, building scalable and reliable solutions in public clouds such as AWS, GCP and Azure. I advocate continuous development, automated testing, clean code and I apply common design patterns so as to maintain as high code quality as possible. I am deeply invested in the open source community and love collaborating and contributing.

- 🔭 I’m preparing to start a new position as backend developer at [doktor.se](https://doktor.se)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on websockets, Redis, k8s, AWS, PostgreSQL, task queues, gRPC
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fredrikaverpil), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredrik/)
