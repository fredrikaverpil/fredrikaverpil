### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate, enthusiastic and professional software developer, continuously striving to evolve with Python as the primary language of choice â€” and preferably building scalable and reliable solutions in public cloud environments. 

I advocate continuous development, automated testing, clean code and the use of common design patterns so as to maintain as high code quality as possible. I am deeply invested in the open source community and love collaborating and contributing.
